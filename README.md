# Netlogo-Templates-Shapes
This is basic Netlogo templates: starter nlogo files, and any extra shapes I can collect

1. $Template.nlogo - has setup, go, and step buttons. Larger graphics window, large display window
2. sun-tick.nls - include file to add a Sun turtle, which rotates around the graphics display, shows the time
3. sun-tick.nlogo - example of sun-tick.nls use, runs out of the box
